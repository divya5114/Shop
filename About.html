the work out of getting dressed, so that you can focus on the work that matters to you.
Who are you?
Maybe you're breaking barriers in the corporate world and need pieces that make you feel comfortable and confident.

 Maybe your work is at home with the kids, and you need an <mark>easy-to-style wardrobe that's 100% machine-washable and
 Twister-friendly</mark>.

 Or maybe you're running for local office, working to create the change you want to see in your community.
<br> We have clothes for you.



<br>
<br>
Who are we?
Our Founder and CEO, Divya got her start as an entrepreneur at a very young age. Frustrated by a lack of women's workwear 
options that were both stylish and practical, she launched Empire in 2023. Since then, we've grown into a team of go-getters who are committed to
 creating a better future for women.
<br>
<br>


<mark>What makes Empire clothes special?</mark>
When we create a piece of clothing,we make sure it encompasses three things: 
functional details (think: adjustable hems and bra-strap holders); comfort (and not just comfortable-for-a-blazer
 comfort-we strive for I-could-nap-in-this comfort); and style-so you can be the most chic, polished person in every
 room you enter. If you're new to our brand, start by checking out our best-selling essentials.

<br>

<mark>High Function, High Style
Our clothes are designed to make you look as good as you feel (read: damn good).</mark>
